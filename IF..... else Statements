 üßÆ If...Else Statements in C
 
- Used to make decisions in programs.
- if checks a condition ‚Äî if it‚Äôs true, a block of code runs.
- If the condition is false, else gives an alternate path.
- You can use else if to check more than one condition.
- It‚Äôs how you teach your program to "think" or make choices based on user input. 


CODES:-

1. write a code for Enter value and check it is less, equal or greater (using if... else Statemenets)

 #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b;

    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

    if(a > b)
        printf("First number is greater\n");
    else if(a < b)
        printf("First number is less\n");
    else
        printf("Both numbers are equal\n");

    return 0;
}

üìù Short Description:
This program takes two numbers as input from the user and compares them using if...else conditions:
- If the first is bigger, it prints "greater".
- If it's smaller, it prints "less".
- If they're the same, it prints "equal".


 2. write a code for nput 2 number and print the maximum among them.

 #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b;

    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

    if(a > b)
        printf("Maximum = %d\n", a);
    else
        printf("Maximum = %d\n", b);

    return 0;
}

üìù Short Description:
This basic program asks the user to enter two numbers.
It then compares them using an if...else statement and prints the larger number as the maximum.


3.  write a code for Input 2 number and print the maximum among them ( using conditional operator)

 #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b;

    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

    int max = (a > b) ? a : b;

    printf("Maximum = %d\n", max);
    return 0;
}

 üìù Short Description:
This program takes two numbers as input and uses the ternary operator
(condition) ? value_if_true : value_if_false to check which one is greater. The result is stored in max and printed.


4. write a code for Input 3 number and print the maximum among them .

  #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b, c, max;

    printf("Enter three numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);

    if(a > b && a > c)
        max = a;
    else if(b > c)
        max = b;
    else
        max = c;

    printf("Maximum = %d\n", max);
    return 0;
}

üìù Short Description:
This program reads three numbers from the user and compares them using if...else conditions
to find the largest value among them. It‚Äôs a basic way to learn decision-making and comparisons in C.


5. write a code for Input 3 number and print the maximum among them. (with conditional operator)


 #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b, c, max;

    printf("Enter three numbers: ");

    printf("Maximum = %d\n", max);
    return 0;
}


 üìù Short Description:
This program takes three integers as input and uses nested conditional (ternary) operators 
to find the largest among them. It‚Äôs a compact way to write decision-making logic without using if...else.


  6. Write a program that find minimum and maximum out of 3 values.

  #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b, c, max, min;

    scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);

    // Max check
    if(a > b && a > c)
        max = a;
    else if(b > c)
        max = b;
    else
        max = c;

    // Min check
    if(a < b && a < c)
        min = a;
    else if(b < c)
        min = b;
    else
        min = c;

    printf("Max = %d\n", max);
    printf("Min = %d\n", min);

    return 0;
}
 üìù Short Description:
This code reads 3 numbers and checks which one is the biggest (max) and smallest (min) using simple conditions.
No shortcuts, no tricks ‚Äî just basic comparisons.


7. Write a program that interchange or swap the values of 2 variables

 #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b, temp;

    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

    // Swapping
    temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
    printf("After swapping: a = %d, b = %d\n", a, b);
    return 0;
}


üìù Short Description:
This program takes two integers from the user and swaps them using a third variable temp.
It's a classic logic-building exercise that teaches how data can be transferred and reassigned between variables.


8. Write a program to interchange the value of 2 variable without using 3rd variable.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b;

    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

    a = a + b;
    b = a - b;
    a = a - b;

    printf("After swapping: a = %d, b = %d\n", a, b);
    return 0;
}

üìù Short Description:
This program swaps two numbers using arithmetic operations. It adds both numbers into a,
then subtracts the original b to get the original a in b, and finally subtracts the new b to get the original b in a. No extra variable needed!



9. Write a program to check whether the entered no is odd or even.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

    if(num % 2 == 0)
        printf("Even\n");
    else
        printf("Odd\n");

    return 0;
}

üìù Short Description:
This program uses the modulus operator % to find the remainder when the number is divided by 2.
If the remainder is 0, it‚Äôs an even number; otherwise, it‚Äôs odd.



10. Get a character in lower case form user and display it in upper case.

 #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char lower, upper;

    printf("Enter a lowercase character: ");
    scanf(" %c", &lower);  // space before %c helps skip any leftover newline

    upper = lower - 32;

    printf("Uppercase = %c\n", upper);
    return 0;
}


 üìù Short Description:
This program takes a lowercase letter as input and converts it to uppercase by subtracting 32 from
its ASCII value (works only for English alphabets). It then prints the uppercase character.


11. Get a character from user and print tell that is it vowel or consonant.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char ch;

    printf("Enter a character: ");
    scanf(" %c", &ch);  // leading space helps skip leftover newline

    // Check for vowels (both uppercase and lowercase)
    if(ch=='a' || ch=='e' || ch=='i' || ch=='o' || ch=='u' ||
       ch=='A' || ch=='E' || ch=='I' || ch=='O' || ch=='U')
        printf("Vowel\n");
    else
        printf("Consonant\n");

    return 0;
}

üìù Short Description:
This program takes a single character input and uses logical conditions (||) to check if it matches any of the vowels.
If it does, it prints ‚ÄúVowel‚Äù; otherwise, it prints ‚ÄúConsonant.‚Äù It also works for both lowercase and uppercase letters.

 
12. Print & calculate area of circle, area of triangle & (f+g)*(f+g) & simple interest & exit in one program.


#include <stdio.h>

        }
    }

    return 0;
}


üìù Short Description:
This program uses a loop and a switch statement to provide a menu with multiple calculation options. 
The user chooses an option, provides the needed inputs, and the program performs the calculation. It keeps running until option 5 is selected to exit.


13. Print & calculate addition, substrection, multiplication & division of two value in one progarm

  #include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    printf("Subtraction = %.2f\n", a - b);
    printf("Multiplication = %.2f\n", a * b);
    
    if(b != 0)
        printf("Division = %.2f\n", a / b);
    else
        printf("Division = Not possible (division by zero)\n");

    return 0;
}


 üìù Short Description:
This program reads two numbers from the user and performs four arithmetic operations.
It also includes a simple safety check to avoid dividing by zero‚Äînice and clean for practicing both input and logic skills.

        printf("\nFinal Result: ATKT\n");
    else
        printf("\nFinal Result: FAIL\n");

    return 0;
}

 üìù Short Description:

        default:
            printf("Invalid choice. Please select between 1 to 4.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

üìù Short Description:
This program uses a switch statement to choose between four geometric shapes. 
Based on the user's selection, it asks for the relevant inputs and calculates the area.
It's a great example of using decision-making with switch-case and handling multiple formulas in one program.

 
16. Write a program that take input of year in 4 digit. Determine whether the year is leap year or not. (try to solve this problem with &&¬†and¬†or¬†operator

 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int year;

    printf("Enter a 4-digit year: ");
    scanf("%d", &year);

    if((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || year % 400 == 0)
        printf("%d is a Leap Year\n", year);
    else
        printf("%d is Not a Leap Year\n", year);

    return 0;
}


 üìù Short Description:
This program checks the leap year rule using:
- && to ensure the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100
- || to allow years divisible by 400 to still be leap years
It‚Äôs how we correctly apply the leap year rule used in calendars

17.  Write a program that determine the grade of steel according to following condition. 
1 Hardness must be greater then 50
2 Carbon must be less then 0.7
3 Tensile must t be be greater then 5500
Take the input for above qualities through keyboard from user Grades are decided as follows.
Grade A if all 3 conditions are met.
Grade B if condition (1) and (2) are met.
Grade C if condition (2) and (3) are met.
Grade D if condition (1) and (3) are met.
Grade E if only one condition met.
Grade F if none of conditions are met.



#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float carbon;
    int hardness, tensile;
    int cond1 = 0, cond2 = 0, cond3 = 0;

    // Input values
    printf("Enter hardness: ");
    scanf("%d", &hardness);

    printf("Enter carbon content (%%): ");
    scanf("%f", &carbon);

    printf("Enter tensile strength: ");
    scanf("%d", &tensile);

    // Condition checks
    if (hardness > 50) cond1 = 1;
    if (carbon < 0.7)  cond2 = 1;
    if (tensile > 5500) cond3 = 1;

    // Grade determination logic
    if (cond1 && cond2 && cond3)
        printf("Grade: A\n");
    else if (cond1 && cond2)
        printf("Grade: B\n");
    else if (cond2 && cond3)
        printf("Grade: C\n");
    else if (cond1 && cond3)

        printf("Grade: E\n");
    else
        printf("Grade: F\n");

    return 0;
}


üìò What It Does
- Takes user input for hardness, carbon %, and tensile strength.
- Uses flags (cond1, cond2, cond3) to track which conditions are satisfied.
- Based on combinations, it prints the appropriate grade ‚Äî simple, readable, and easy to test!


18. Write a program to find maximum from 3 values using conditional operator.


  #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b, c, max;

    // Input
    printf("Enter three integers: ");
    scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);

    // Using nested conditional operators to find max
    max = (a > b) ? ((a > c) ? a : c) : ((b > c) ? b : c);

    // Output
    printf("Maximum value: %d\n", max);

    return 0;
}


 üìò Short Description
This program reads three integers from the user and applies nested ternary operators
(?:) to determine the greatest number. It‚Äôs a concise alternative to if-else statements, ideal for quick decision-making logic.


19. Write a program that generate same output as of program no (10) using break statement.


 #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b, c, max;

    // Input
    printf("Enter three integers: ");
    scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);

    while (1) {
        if (a >= b && a >= c) {
            max = a;
            break;
        } else if (b >= a && b >= c) {
            max = b;
            break;
        } else {
            max = c;
            break;
        }
    }

    // Output
    printf("Maximum value: %d\n", max);

    return 0;
}


üìò Short Description
This program uses a while (1) infinite loop along with break statements to exit as soon as 
the maximum value among the three inputs is found. It mimics the decision-making process from program 
10 but swaps out conditional operators for control-flow logic


 
20. Write a program that performs the sum of given numbers until user says no using Go-To statement.


 #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num, sum = 0;
    char choice;

start:
    // Input number
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);
    sum += num;

    // Ask user if they want to continue
    printf("Do you want to add another number? (y/n): ");
    scanf(" %c", &choice);

    // If yes, go back to input
    if (choice == 'y' || choice == 'Y')
        goto start;

    // Final result
    printf("Total sum: %d\n", sum);
    return 0;
}


 üìò Short Description
This program uses the goto statement to jump back to a labeled section (start:) whenever the user decides to add another number.
It keeps accumulating the total in a sum variable and exits only when the user inputs 'n' or 'N'.
It's a simple example of manual flow control ‚Äî retro, but still educational


 21. Write a sample program that demonstrate the use of Continue statement.


 ##include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5;

    // Manually simulate skipping an operation
    if (a % 2 == 0) {
        // Simulated continue: skip this block
    } else {
        // Action you'd normally do after continue skips others
        printf("The number %d is odd\n", a);
    }

    return 0;
}


üìù Short Description. 
This C program uses an if-else structure to simulate the effect of skipping a condition, 
similar to what continue does inside loops. If the number is even, the program does nothing. 
If it's odd, it prints the result ‚Äî demonstrating conditional flow without loop constructs.
